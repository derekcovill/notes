# Solidworks (PC only)
is...
1. Parametric: everything is driven by numbers (length, diameter, thickness, colour, etc). 
2. Feature-based: geometry is created with features
3. Associative: parts, assembles, drawings are linked - a change in one will filter to all

SW can do: FEA, CFD, motion analysis, electronic wiring, lots more!

Student licences- Â£6 for a USB from computer store, 1st Floor Watts Building. Renew at the start of each academic year. 

[Certification exams:](https://www.solidworks.com/sw/support/mcad-certification-programs.htm) we will provide these: TBA
## Resources:
- Start with these.....Help menu > tutorials (Lesson1: parts, Lesson2: Assembles, Lesson3: drawings) - these are excellent, make notes, observe everything and master them.
- [lesson 1: parts video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKSo99hGDd4)
- 
- use the help (online also)
- Grabcad/Thingyverse/etc (filter for Solidworks models). 
- any existing models to reverse engineer
- Lynda.com (for UoB: www.brighton.ac.uk/lynda) - Solidworks 20XX essentials. 
- sketching exercises
- part modelling exercises

## Layout:
- [user interface](http://help.solidworks.com/2018/english/SolidWorks/sldworks/c_user_interface_overview.htm?id=3142cd59ed8f4abd874df330c405866b#Pg0)

Units: see bottom right hand corner

## Navigation:
MIDDLE DOES EVERYTHING! 
- zoom: scroll middle 
- rotate: hold middle 
- pan: hold middle + CTRL

## File types: (IMAGE OF EACH)
1. [Parts: as it would be manufactured](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/zNDwvsU5Dko/maxresdefault.jpg)
2. [Assemblies: a collection of parts (and/or of other sub-assemblies)](https://www.javelin-tech.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/solidworks-rigid-subassembly-780x417.jpg)
3. Drawings: orthographic of [parts (with dimensions)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/k_45Xr3wHtk/maxresdefault.jpg) and [assemblies (with NO dimensions, with balloons + bill of materials (BOM))](https://ayoqq.org/images/assembly-drawing-engineering-2.png)....or [both](https://ayoqq.org/images/solidworks-drawing-solidworks-assembly-13.jpg)

## Basic part modelling process:
1. Create new sketch
2. Select plane or flat surface to sketch on
3. Draw 2D sketch (open or closed)
4. Exit sketch
5. Use sketch to create feature

Follow these steps, be methodical

### Sketch entities: (note different options for each)
- line
- arc
- rectangle
- circle
- spline (avoid where possible)
- use smart dimensions ALWAYS
- toggle construction lines on/off

### Sketch tools:
- convert entities
- offset entities
- trim (oh power trim!!)
- mirror/pattern

### Sketch relations:
- coincident
- concentric
- equal
- parallel
- perpendicular
- colinear
- coradial

### Basic features: 
- extrude/cut
- revolve/cut
- hole wizard
Intermediate features:
- sweep/cut
- loft/cut
- pattern
- mirror

## Early challenge:
- create a 6-sided die (10x10x10mm, R1mm fillets on all faces, D2mm holes 0.5mm deep (opposing sides add up to 7)
- all details must be dimensioned fully
- approach this in different ways, aim to do it as fast as you can
- record < 1min, excellent < 5min, ok < 15min

## Useful tools:
- [toolbox (nuts, bolts, gears etc)](http://help.solidworks.com/2018/english/solidworks/toolbox/t_toolbox_activating_add_ins.htm)
