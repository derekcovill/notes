# Solidworks (PC only)
is...
1. Parametric: everything is driven by numbers (length, diameter, thickness, colour, etc). 
2. Feature-based: geometry is created with features
3. Associative: parts, assembles, drawings are linked - a change in one will filter to all

SW can do: FEA, CFD, motion analysis, electronic wiring.

Student licences- Â£6 for a USB from computer store, 1st Floor Watts Building. Renew at the start of each academic year. 

[Certification exams:](https://www.solidworks.com/sw/support/mcad-certification-programs.htm) we will provide these: TBA
## Resources:
- Help > tutorials (start with Lesson1: parts, Lesson2: Assembles, Lesson3: drawings - these are excellent, master them).
- Lynda.com (for UoB: www.brighton.ac.uk/lynda) - Solidworks 20XX essentials. 
- Grabcad/Thingyverse/etc (filter for Solidworks models). 
- any existing models to reverse engineer
- sketching exercises
- part modelling exercises

## Layout:
LABELLED IMAGE GOES HERE.

Units: see bottom right hand corner

## Navigation:
- zoom: scroll middle 
- rotate: hold middle 
- pan: hold middle + CTRL

## File types: (IMAGE OF EACH)
1. Parts: as it would be manufactured
2. Assemblies: a collection of parts (and/or of other sub-assemblies)
3. Drawings: orthographic of parts (with dimensions) and assemblies (with NO dimensions, with balloons + bill of materials (BOM))

## Basic part modelling process: (VIDEO)
1. Create new sketch
2. Select plane or flat surface to sketch on 
3. Draw 2D sketch (open or closed)
4. Exit sketch
5. Use sketch to create feature

### Sketch entities: (note different options)
- line
- arc
- rectangle
- circle
- spline (avoid where possible)
- use smart dimensions ALWAYS

### Sketch tools:
- convert entities
- offset entities
- 

### Sketch relations:
- coincident
- concentric
- equal
- parallel
- perpendicular
- colinear
- coradial

### Basic features: (IMAGES OF EACH OR SINGLE PARTS WITH EACH)
- extrude/cut
- revolve/cut
- hole wizard
Intermediate features:
- sweep/cut
- loft/cut
- pattern
- mirror

## Early challenge:
- create a 6-sided die (10x10x10mm, R1mm fillets on all faces, D2mm holes 0.5mm deep (opposing sides add up to 7)
- all details must be dimensioned fully
- approach this in different ways, aim to do it as fast as you can
- record < 1min, excellent < 5min

## Useful tools:
- toolbox (nuts, bolts, gears etc)
-
