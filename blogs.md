# Blogs (for UoB students)

[Blogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog) are websites. 

goto http://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/createnew/ and select the first (or if you like the 2nd) option. 

Follow the instructions to name and create your site. Note that this will be a [wordpress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress) site that is hosted within the University. 

Note also the publication settings (internal or external, searchable or not, etc).

## Resources:
- [edublocks userguide](https://help.edublogs.org/user-guide/)
- [image formatting](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206542517-Formatting-your-images-for-display-on-the-web)

## Site structure:
- note you can use posts (chronological) or pages (static)
- use categories to help sort by subject
- use tags to help search by keywords/topics
- consider your menu structure (draw a tree diagram)
- play around at first
- then decide and be consistent throughout

## Considerations:
- embed video (do not upload)
- label+manage files+images like a jedi. Never upload a full res image
- note only 1Gb storage capacity
- love your blog and show it off!

## Assignment:

Create your edublog, go through the [edublocks userguide](https://help.edublogs.org/user-guide/) and the [image formatting](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/206542517-Formatting-your-images-for-display-on-the-web) guides. 

Play around and populate your site:
- test out some themes (noting requirements for image sizes/ratios etc)
- create an about me page, upload+include an appropriately formatted+labelled image, embed an external video from youtube/vimeo/other
- create a reflective post about your first(?) experience with wordpress
- in both cases, use tags and categories
- create a menu (or multiple menus) and add these to your site as widgets
- submit the URL of your site into the assessment submission area on Studentcentral. Add a short note about what you have submitted. Check with your tutor that they can access the site. Submit again each week with a short update on progress.
